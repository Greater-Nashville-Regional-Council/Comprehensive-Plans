## Overview

This is a template for recreating the materials associated with our Planning Department's Comprehensive Plans. 

## File Structure   

+ Functions and Dictionaries  
    This folder contains .py files kept here for consistency. There are a series of formatting and visualization functions, there is also a .py file called "geodict" that contains dictionaries compiled over time that allows us to transform between different geography name formats, and connect or disconnect these geography names from different geocode formats.  

+ "Geography"  
    Each plan is referred to by the primary geography name. These folders contain the following folders:  
    + At a Glance Posters: notebook producing the appropriate information to populate the posters used at Community Engagement Meetings  
    + Powerpoints: notebook producing the appropriate information for frequently created powerpoints  
    + Technical Document Figure Generation: This contains notebooks broken out by category to produce the c. 250 MatplotLib figures used in the Technical Document and Appendix. This folder also contains a notebook that writes all of these documents into a word document for planning staff to select from.
